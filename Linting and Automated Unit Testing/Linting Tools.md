#### Linting Tools

Linting is an essential part in your code review, and it saves you time and helps you write cleaner code. Linting tools analyze your code for potential errors, including scope conflicts. Keep in mind that although code you’ve written works well in development, that doesn’t always guarantee that the code will work in production. Since linting tools are open source, they’re readily available for your use.

Note: Even though linting tools are a valuable resource, always combine them with unit and functional tests and code reviews.
